# Doubts to ask at the first meeting session

- Do we have to load files into Mongo/HBase/HDFS and work on top of these systems or shall we work and process each file locally?
  - If so, even after performing data cleaning and reconciliation it is just necessary store data on local files?
- What abstraction do we have to use to describe pipes?
- Shall we join data in order to have optimised queries?
- Is it proper the dataset about building age? And working on it making a mean?
